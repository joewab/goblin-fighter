# Goblin Fighter

This is a a tool for dungeon masters using the DnD 5e game system.

In the case that their party forces monsters to fight amongst themselves, this can simulate the dice rolls and outcomes of two monsters fighting.

I'm using the dnd5eapi ([text](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)) to get the data.
